## Overview
This is an inferior remake of the classic game Brick Breaker. There is a Ball, a Paddle, and many Bricks. The goal is to bounce the Ball off the Paddle and try to clear all the Bricks with the Ball. If the Ball falls below the Paddle, you lose. If all the bricks are cleared, you win. In Difficult mode, the same conditions apply. However, the Paddle width becomes exponentially smaller as each Brick is cleared. In Cheat Mode, there is just one Ball and one Brick, with no Paddle. The point is to watch the Ball hit the Brick and you win. Currently, there is an error, which is likely caused by numbers that are mismatched. If this occurs, the Ball will "chain" and continue bouncing off one another, sometimes clearing a majority of a row, or the Ball will dance around the Paddle not moving. 
## Instructions
1. Start on the start screen. Hover over the Normal/Difficult option to start. Look the highlight. The default is Normal. Then press the ENTER key to start or press the Right mouse button to Cheat.
2. In Normal/Difficult, use the left/right keys or A/D keys to move the Paddle in that direction. The ball will bounce off the Paddle and then bounce off a Brick. Otherwise, in Cheat mode, just watch your screen win.
3. If you have no more balls, you lose. If you have no more bricks, you win. To play again, press the ENTER key. To return to menu to change game modes, press the BACKSPACE key.
